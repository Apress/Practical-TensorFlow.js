    <h1>Doing k-means in TensorFlow.js with ml5.js</h1>
    <h2>Exploring the basic blocks of TensorFlow.js with unsupervised learning and an external package</h2>
    <h3 class="header-border">Introduction</h3>
    <p>In this web app, we'll fit a k-means model to cluster a dataset while the external libraries ml5.js and
      Plotly.</p>
    <p><b class="keywords">k-means</b> is a classic unsupervised learning algorithm that theoretically groups every
      data observations with others similar to it by dividing an unlabeled dataset into k clusters.
    </p>

    <p>Here, we'll apply k-means to a synthetic dataset to learn its classes in an unsupervised manner. This dataset
      consists of 100 observations, two features, and three classes that aren't explicitly labeled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike the previous examples, in this one, we won't define the model from scratch. Instead, we'll use the
      one implemented in <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>, a library built on top of
      TensorFlow.js that simplifies many of its processes.
      Besides this, we'll also use the visualization library <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/"
        target="_blank">Plotly</a>
      to plot the dataset and the clustering result.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header-border">Training the model</h3>
    <p>
      Compared to writing the algorithm from scratch, using the ml5.js <a
        href="https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/reference/kmeans" target="_blank">implementation</a> is a
      straightforward
      process. It involves calling the kmeans function using as a parameter a JSON object, or a link (either a url
      or a local path) to a CSV or JSON dataset. Optionally, we could also use an options object to override
      certain values like the <code>k</code> (the number of clusters), and <code>maxIter</code>, or the maximum
      number of iterations.
      Also, it accepts a callback function that is called once the algorithm finishes. The following line shows
      the function call.
    </p>
    <pre>
            <code>
                // The k-means model configuration
                const options = {
                  'k': k,
                  'maxIter': 20,
                };
              
                // Arguments are the file's path, the config, and a callback
                // function that is called once the clustering is finished
                model = ml5.kmeans(csvUrl, options, visualizeResult);

                function visualizeResult() {
                    ...
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
      The first structure &mdash; <code>options</code> &mdash; contains the model's configuration. In it, we are
      setting
      <code>k</code> to a manual
      value we'll define later, and <code>maxIter</code> to 20. Then, we call the <code>kmeans</code> function,
      using as the first parameter
      the dataset's path, followed by options, and the callback function <code>visualizeResult</code>, which
      visualizes the
      clustering outcome once the algorithm converges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's proceed to train the model. To do so, please select the desired k from the slide below.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Select the number of clusters (1 to 4)</h4>
      <input type="range" id="k-range" min="1" max="4" value="1">
      <p>k: <span id="k-value"></span></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now, click the following button to start the training.
    </p>
    <h4>Click to fit the model</h4>
    <div id="button"></div>
    <script>
      // This script retrieves the slider's value to display
      // it in another element
      var slider = document.getElementById('k-range');
      var output = document.getElementById('k-value');
      output.innerHTML = slider.value;

      slider.oninput = function () {
        output.innerHTML = this.value;
      }
    </script>
    <h3 class="header-border">Visualizing the clustering result</h3>
    <div id="plot"></div>
    <p>
      In the plot above (visible if you clicked the "cluster" button), you'll find the dataset and the different
      clusters coded by color and shape. If k was
      1, then you'll notice that all the points have the same color and shape since they all belong to the same
      cluster. In other words, according to the algorithm, every row of the dataset belongs to the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we know this isn't true because there are actually three classes in the dataset. Nevertheless, this
      trade-off between a small and large k (as we'll shortly see) is one of the main attributes of k-means. If
      chosen wrong, it might yield poor results. Yet, the flexibility of being able to control this value is also
      one of the key features, and we could also say, advantages of the algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the other values of k, if it is 2, then you'll most likely have 2 blobs under the same cluster,
      and the remaining one as another. If it equals 3, hopefully, each group has a different label, and if k is
      4, then you'll have one blob with two classes.
