# Building a Logistic Regression Model from Scratch

## Introduction
In this first exercise, you will implement and train a logistic regression model from scratch using the basic blocks of TensorFlow.js and the Layers API. Since we are in a web environment, in this project (and all the others), you will contain the model in a web application from the user will be able to interact with it.

Additionally, to make the application a richer one and to understand better the data, the app will make use of the tfjs-vis library, a visualization package part of the TensorFlow ecosystem that provides tools for visualizing data and specific properties of a model.

## Running the app
For this exercise, the only thing you will need is a web browser (this applies to all of them), and your preferred code editor. Nothing else. As it was explained in the book's first chapter, the app will use the CDN approach to download the libraries, so you will not need to install anything. So, create a new project, open the code editor and let's get started.

To run it, go to your computer's file manager (Finder on Mac, or File Explorer on Window), and double click on the index.html file to open the web app in your default web browser.
