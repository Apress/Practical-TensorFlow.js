        <h1>Building a Logistic Regression Model from Scratch</h1>
        <h2>Exploring the basic blocks of TensorFlow.js with unsupervised learning</h2>
        <h3 class="header-border">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            In this web app, we'll fit a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of a toy dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b class="keywords">Logistic regression</b> is a supervised learning and statistical approach that searches
            to model an association between a set of independent variables, also known as the predictors, and a discrete
            dependent variable, known as the target or the class target. In other words, it uses a collection of
            attributes or "features" as they are most commonly named, to learn to classify them into a category.

        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of a binary logistic regression model, such as the one we'll implement here, this target
            variable has two possible values, e.g., "0" or "1", "spam" or "not spam," or "cat" or "dog." However, and
            this is the reason why it is called a statistical model, is that instead of directly producing these kinds
            of responses, the algorithm's output is the probability of the default case. For example, suppose we have a
            model to predict whether this message is spam or not, and we test the model with an instance of it. Its
            output is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 means that the model is 100% confident that this message is
            "spam" and 0 indicates that the message is 0% likely to be spam. Typically, the threshold is drawn at 0.5,
            meaning that anything above that number is considered the "true" response, e.g., "spam," while any value &#8804;
            0.5 is the "false" one ("no-spam"). 
        </p> 
        <p>
            This exercise's dataset is a synthetic one I created. It consists of 700 observations of two normally
            distributed features, and its target variable named "label." The data is perfectly balanced, with 349
            points belonging to the class "0", and 351 to class "1." To make the dataset is suitable for a
            classification problem, there's interdependence between the features.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-border">Visualizing the dataset with tfjs-vis</h3>
        <p>Throughout many of the exercises, we'll use the tfjs-vis extension to visualize the data, aspects of the
            training phase, and details of the model. On this occasion, we'll plot the dataset in a scatterplot. To do
            so, click the following button.</p>
        <div id="visualize"></div>

        <p>
            On the right part of the screen, you should see a tab or a <b class="keywords">visor</b> as it is known in
            tfjs-vis, displaying the
            dataset. At the bottom of the graph, are the observations belonging to the class "0", while the top-center
            region contains the class "1." Since there's a clear gap between both classes (except for the minimal
            noise), the model should be able to find the separation quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            To close or open the visor, press the backtick "<code>`</code>" key.
        </p>
        <h3>Training the Model</h3>
        <p>
            The model we're about to train is a TensorFlow.js Sequential model of only one layer. The layer's input
            shape is 2, its number of units is 1, and the activation function is sigmoid. This is how the definition
            looks like:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                // Define the model.
                const model = tf.sequential();

                // Add a Dense layer to the Sequential model
                model.add(tf.layers.dense({
                    inputShape: [numOfFeatures],
                    units: 1,
                    activation: 'sigmoid',
                }));
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Once defined, the following step is to compile it, which means preparing all the layers and the model
            configuration for training. At this step, we need to specify the training optimizer, loss function, and
            evaluation metric. Ours are Adam, binary cross-entropy, and accuracy, respectively. This is the code.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                model.compile({
                    optimizer: tf.train.adam(0.1),
                    loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',
                    metrics: ['accuracy']
                });
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Lastly, we call the <code>fitDataset</code> function to fit the model. In this one, we'll specify the number
            of epochs
            &mdash;
            the number of times the complete training dataset traverses the model &mdash; two callback functions that
            execute at the end of each epoch, and another one that prints a message when the training is over. The first
            of these functions display the training loss and accuracy
            evolution in the tfjs-vis visor, and the second print the log to the console. This is how the function looks
            like.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                await model.fitDataset(flattenedDataset, {
                    epochs: numberEpochs,
                    callbacks: [
                      tfvis.show.fitCallbacks(
                        trainingSurface,
                        ['loss', 'acc'],
                        { callbacks: ['onEpochEnd'] }
                      ),
                      {
                        onEpochEnd: async (epoch, logs) => {
                          console.log(epoch + ':' + logs.loss);
                        }
                      },
                      {
                        onTrainEnd: async (logs) => {
                          console.log('Training has ended.')
                        }
                      }],
                  });
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            We'll manually set the number of epochs in the field below.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-border">Enter number of epochs</h3>
        <label for="number-epochs">Number of epochs (between 1 and 20):</label>
        <input type="number" id="number-epochs" name="number-epochs" min="1" max="20" value="5" style="width: 5em">
        <h3 class="header-border">Click to fit the model</h3>
        <div id="train"></div>
        <p>
            After starting the training, you'll see on the visor two dynamic lines that change over time. These values
            represent the training's loss and accuracy value at the end of each epoch.
        </p>
        <p>With that, we end our first exercise :)</p>
