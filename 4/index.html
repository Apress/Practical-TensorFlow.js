        <h1>Handwritten Digits Detection App</h1>
        <h2>Using Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
        <h3 class="header-border">Description</h3>
        <p>For this chapter's exercise, you will build an app that fits a convolutional neural network using the MNIST
            dataset to
            identify in real-time handwritten digits. At first, as we did with the others, we will load the dataset,
            design
            the
            model, and train it. Then, we will develop the drawing functionality. This feature involves setting up a
            canvas
            where
            the user will draw a digit using its mouse. After drawing the digit, the app converts the image to a tensor
            and
            feeds it
            to the model to recognize the input value.</p>

        <h3 class="header-border">About convolutional neural networks</h3>
        <p>A convolutional neural network (Y. LeCun et al., 1989) is a type of neural network that simulates the brain's
            visual
            cortex functions to extract and recognize the features of an image. Once extracted, the network learns that
            these
            features form the object; e.g., a cat is a cat because of these features.

            At its core, a CNN involves two different kinds of layers: convolutional layer (hence the name), and pooling
            layer. A convolutional layer computes a
            convolution
            operation to extract the image's main features. The pooling layer reduce (i.e., sub-sample) the spatial size
            of the input image to reduce the number of parameters of the network,
            lessening the risk of overfitting the model.</p>
        <h3 class="header-border">About the MNIST dataset</h3>
        <p>The dataset we will use to train the convnet is the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology
            or MNIST
            (Yann LeCun et al., 2010) dataset of handwritten digits. This well-known dataset, often used for
            benchmarking machine
            learning models and architectures, has over 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits between 0
            and 9. Figure
            4-6 shows a sample.</p>
